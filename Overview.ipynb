    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Potentially this will be a precise marketplace for showcasing skills as well as potential employers to come and look for new talent, instead of hunting for them via various channels like YouTube, portfolios and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitchfork is just the starting point to gather reviews of independent artists from and classify them into labels so that it is easy for employers to look through them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note here is there are millions of independent artists there on different websites - how do we track them? how do we connect with them? where should we go see and hear their work? How and who do we compare their work to?  \"American Idol\" gives a platform to few talented individuals - what happens to the rest? How do we give them a voice? \n",
    "The data out there on these individual artists is big... really big... that is the real world big data challenge this startup will address. The data will be in terabytes or pegabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is but the first stepping stone to take data from one data source - Pitchfork(http://pitchfork.com/) and build an end-to-end system.\n"

    "The project is far from done, obviously. Keeping in mind the project scope, the first step is to gather reviews about independent artists, their music albums and genre and build a big data system end to end that is robust, can scale and fits the other desirable big data properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one unique thing about Pitchfork is that ratings for a particular album can be a zero. This is different from all other ratings site because the reviewers are allowed to rate a music album as zero based on their perception of the artist, genre and album amongst other things. \n",

    "1) I used the code \"pf_minor.py\" to webscrape Pitchfork (see the pf_minor.py code and run it in PyCharm if you can to see it execute). This script uses \"Threadpoolexecutor\" and \"Beautiful Soup\" to webscrape the Pitchfork reviews page.This grabs enitre history of reviews and stores it in S3.\n",
